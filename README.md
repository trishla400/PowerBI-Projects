Objective of the Power BI Project:

The objective of this Power BI project is to create an interactive and actionable dashboard that provides stakeholders in the hospitality industry with insights into their key performance metrics. The analysis focuses on understanding patterns in revenue, occupancy, cancellations, and customer behavior, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to optimize operations, enhance profitability, and improve guest experiences. Specifically, the objectives include:
________________________________________
Revenue Analysis:

•	Identify revenue generated across different dimensions, such as:
	o	Room category (e.g., standard, deluxe, suite).
	o	Hotel category (e.g., budget, luxury).
	o	Hotel location (city-wise).
	o	Property IDs for granular analysis.
•	Track revenue trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly) to identify growth opportunities and peak performance periods.
________________________________________
Occupancy Insights:

•	Compare occupancy rates for weekdays vs. weekends, considering that Fridays and Saturdays are treated as weekends in the hospitality industry.
•	Analyze room class performance to identify high-demand segments.
________________________________________
Cancellations and Refunds:

•	Examine cancellation rates across:
o	Booking platforms (e.g., direct bookings, OTAs like Booking.com, Expedia).
o	Hotel categories and cities.
•	Calculate revenue loss due to cancellations and refund amounts, considering the policy of 60% refund upon cancellations.
•	Highlight cancellation patterns for urgent bookings (same-day or one-day prior bookings) and propose solutions to mitigate revenue loss (e.g., stricter refund policies for such cases).
________________________________________
Key Metrics:

•	ADR (Average Daily Rate): Measure average revenue generated per occupied room per day.
•	RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): Measure overall room revenue efficiency.
•	Cancellation Rates and Loss Analysis: Quantify the impact of cancellations on revenue and identify actionable areas to reduce losses.
________________________________________
Customer Preferences:

•	Analyze booking platform preferences to understand customer behavior and optimize channel strategies.
•	Track booking lead time (difference between booking date and check-in date) to segment guests into planners, last-minute bookers, and opportunistic travelers.
________________________________________
Guest Satisfaction:

•	Evaluate ratings by property to identify top-performing properties and those needing improvement.
•	Correlate ratings with revenue to identify if highly rated properties generate higher profitability.
________________________________________
Operational Improvements:

•	Calculate room nights to assess the total number of rooms sold and unsold over time.
•	Provide actionable insights to improve resource allocation and inventory management.
________________________________________
Growth Trends:

•	Analyze month-over-month (MoM) and week-over-week (WoW) revenue growth to track overall performance and identify growth opportunities.
________________________________________
This dashboard will enable stakeholders to:

1.	Optimize Revenue and Profitability: By adjusting pricing strategies, targeting high-performing segments, and reducing cancellations.
2.	Improve Guest Experience: By addressing concerns reflected in reviews and feedback.
3.	Enhance Operational Efficiency: By identifying and addressing bottlenecks in occupancy and cancellations.
4.	Strengthen Decision-Making: With clear, data-driven insights and trend analysis to shape future strategies
